  <h1>Computer Vision Unmanned Robot Vertical Alignment</h1>
  <p>Gazebo simulation environment provides a safe place to test robotic systems and algorithms, reducing the time and cost of development. The researchers implemented domain randomization and style transfer in LIRS World Construction Tool to generate Gazebo worlds to emulate the real-world setting automatically. UGV specifications are divided into functional components such as differential drive and sensor inputs, which are directly interfaced into ROS2.

YOLOv5 offers an auto anchor feature for adapting to changes in image scale and the ratio of a dataset. It allows objects with varying image ratios and scales to have different anchor points depending on their position and rotation. The researcher aims to combine this with a DIST-YOLO method that modifies the original loss function with a distance estimation. The researchers expect a segmented distance estimation in each anchor point generated by YOLOv5. The advantage of this is distance estimation of UAV objects in varying image scales and ratios depending on camera and object angle, position, and rotation.</p>
